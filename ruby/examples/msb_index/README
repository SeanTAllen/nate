About this example:

A simple example using the nate command line tool to build a website. The example is rather abbreviated- it only builds a single page from my website http://www.monkeysnatchbanana.com. Uses compass to build the css required for the site.

We use a single template 'templates/index.html' to define the markup for our site and fill it in uses the posts.yaml file that defines the content. We fill in 3 primary elements, our header, footer and the main content- the current posts
including a link to them and a short summary of the content.

To run the example so it can be viewed in a web browser:

rake run
then point your web browser at http://localhost:4567/

To build the site so you can see what the output from the nate run looks like:

rake build
then examine the output content in public/

To clean up after either of the above tasks and get back to a fresh starting point:

rake clean
