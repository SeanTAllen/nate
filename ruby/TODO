Added larger scale examples rather than just the simple ones we have on github wiki

Add specs once we are a bit more settled.

Look for nokogiri gotchas

Needs some more testing to figure out what happens if we match multiple items in select.
Might want to limit to ids only.
This is underway with the ## tests. Need to beef up other plain select tests to match.

Refactor/rework features. Maybe break up into smaller features? Certainly, reword.

Consider adding helper functions to Nate::Engine that allow you to make discrete changes
in a more 'compact' format like set_attr( 'href', 'http://www.example.com' ) which would set
any href attribute to http://www.example.com. It might have some value. No immediate concern.
Just consider for now.

Cleanup requires in the bin/nate script.

Test how template composition would work with yaml in bin/nate.

check case sensitivity of tags

deal with mangled DOCTYPE string that comes from passing it through Nokogiri::XML.fragment

xml probably doesnt work due to namespaces

feature to test namespace handling

xpaths are totally broken in nokogiri right now. add xpaths support and tests once that is fixed.

refactor code now that is got all messed up by the @@ for attribute addition.

more tests for @@ attribute code. should handle 'that aint supposed to happen situations' like:
'a @@href p' gracefully. right now i have no idea what happens with illogical stuff like that.
