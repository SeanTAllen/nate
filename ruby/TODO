Added larger scale examples rather than just the simple ones we have on github wiki

Refactor transform_list in Nate::Engine

Add specs once we are a bit more settled.

Look for hpricot gotchas

Needs some more testing to figure out what happens if we match multiple items in select.
Might want to limit to ids only.

Refactor/rework features. Maybe break up into smaller features? Certainly, reword.

Added 'full template' sinatra to do example.

Consider adding helper functions to Nate::Engine that allow you to make discrete changes
in a more 'compact' format like set_attr( 'href', 'http://www.example.com' ) which would set
any href attribute to http://www.example.com. It might have some value. No immediate concern.
Just consider for now.
