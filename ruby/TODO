Review new features w/ James. See if we can improve the wording.

Added larger scale examples rather than just the simple ones we have on github wiki

Refactor transform_list in Nate::Engine

Add specs once we are a bit more settled.

Figure out why the hpricot hacks I used to get tests passing ( see attribute check code )

Look for hpricot gotchas

to_html call should have a less ruby specific name

Needs some more testing to figure out what happens if we match multiple items in select.
Might want to limit to ids only.
