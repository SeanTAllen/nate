Refactor transform_list in Nate::Engine

Add specs once we are a bit more settled.

Figure out why the hpricot hacks I used to get tests passing ( see attribute check code )

Needs some more testing to figure out what happens if we match multiple items in select.
Might want to limit to ids only.

Refactor/rework features. Maybe break up into smaller features? Certainly, reword.

Split sintra example into one that does 'raw' template include ( current ) and one
that uses composition using full rather than partials for templates and uses select
to combine.
