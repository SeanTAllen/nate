Things left to do for Java Nate:
 * Make sure Engine really is thread safe!!
 * Remove the need for clients to distinguish between html docs and html fragments.
 * Make sure exceptions include useful information, especially for bad css selectors.
 * Try some real HTML parsers (eg tagsoup).
 * Allow option of not having injected text HTML escaped.
 * Handle 'attr:' selectors.
 * Revisit this: {'div' => {'div' => 'foo'}}.  Should it be equivalent to {'div' => 'foo'} or {'div div' => 'foo'}
 * Fix build and ivy config to make it clear what the nate runtime dependencies are.
 * Convince css-selectors library author to upload a release to a maven repo or do it ourselves.
 * Test NullEncoder.
 * Fix behaviour of select() when it matches nodes that are descendants of other matching nodes.
 * Allow output to be via InputStream.
 * Revisit character encoding issues.
 * Allow rendered output to (optionally) have an xml declaration tag.
 * Fix terms used for internal code: i.e. fragment, html, node, template...
 * More tests!!!
