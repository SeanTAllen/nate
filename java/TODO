Things left to do for Java Nate:
 * Support attribute removal
 * Make sure Engine really is thread safe!!
 * Remove the need for clients to distinguish between html docs and html fragments.
 * Try some real HTML parsers (eg tagsoup).
 * Allow option of not having injected text HTML escaped.
 * Revisit this: {'div' => {'div' => 'foo'}}.  Should it be equivalent to {'div' => 'foo'} or {'div div' => 'foo'}
 * Revisit this: {'div' => {'*content*' => {'div' => 'foo'}}}
 * Fix build and ivy config to make it clear what the nate runtime dependencies are.
 * Convince css-selectors library author to upload a release to a maven repo or do it ourselves.
 * Allow output to be via InputStream.
 * Revisit character encoding issues.
