Things left to do for Java Nate:
 * Fix thread safety issues.
 * Remove the need for clients to distinguish between html docs and html fragments.
 * Add current encoders as XML encoders as well as html encoders.
 * Add support for call-backs.
 * Consider what to do with {'@@foo' => ['a', 'b', 'c']}
 * Try some real HTML parsers (eg tagsoup).
 * Allow option of not having injected text HTML escaped.
 * Revisit this: {'div' => {'div' => 'foo'}}.  Should it be equivalent to {'div' => 'foo'} or {'div div' => 'foo'}
 * Revisit this: {'div' => {'*content*' => {'div' => 'foo'}}}
 * Fix build and ivy config to make it clear what the nate runtime dependencies are.
