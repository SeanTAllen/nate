NATE - Not Another Template Engine
This project helps keep your html free of program code and your code free of html.

For more details on NATE you should visit the wiki https://github.com/jamesladd/nate/wiki
There is additional information in the README's of each language specific subproject.

** In a Nutshell **

If you think:

* HTML/ERB/RHTML should NOT be peppered with <%= %> or <% %> statements,
* Moving <%= %> and <% %> statements when the presentation changes is frustrating,

Then Nate is for you.

In short we think this: <ul><li class="actor-character"></li></ul>

is preferrable to this:

<ul>
  <% for actor in @cast %>
    <li><%= actor.character %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
