NATE - Not Another Template Engine

Keeping your html free of programming logic and your code free of html since 2010.

What is Nate?

Nate is a logic less and value less templating engine. What does that mean? Your templates are 
plain markup. There is no special templating mini-language that is used to
create the final output. Instead, you provide a data structure that and a template to the Nate
engine that uses applies a set of rules to interpret the data structure and transform the template
as needed.
