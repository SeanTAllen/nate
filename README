NATE - Not Another Template Engine
This project helps keep your html free of program code and your code free of html.

For more details on NATE you should visit the wiki https://github.com/jamesladd/nate/wiki
There is additional information in the README's of each language specific subproject.

** In a Nutshell **

If you think your HTML/ERB/RHTML should NOT be peppered with <%= %> or <% %> statements
then Nate is for you. If it frustrates you when a small change in the presentation requires
lots of moving of <%= %> and <% %> statements then Nate is for you.

In short, we think this:

<ul><li class="actor-character"></li></ul>

is preferrable to this:

<ul>
  <% for actor in @cast %>
    <li><%= actor.character %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
