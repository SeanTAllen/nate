NATE - Not Another Template Engine

Keeping your html free of programming logic and your code free of html since 2010.

What is Nate?

Nate is a logic less and value less templating engine. What does that mean? Your templates are 
plain markup. There is no special templating mini-language that is used to
create the final output. Instead, you provide a data structure that and a template to the Nate
engine that uses applies a set of rules to interpret the data structure and transform the template
as needed. 

Why would I use Nate?

When wouldn't I want to use Nate?

There is additional information in the README's of each language specific subproject.

** In a Nutshell **

If you think:

* HTML/ERB/RHTML should NOT be peppered with <%= %> or <% %> statements,
* Moving <%= %> and <% %> statements when the presentation changes is frustrating,

Then Nate is for you.

In short we think this: <ul><li class="actor-character"></li></ul>

is preferrable to this:

<ul>
  <% for actor in @cast %>
    <li><%= actor.character %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
